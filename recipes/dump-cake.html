    <h1>Description</h1>
    
    <p>This dump cake is as easy as dumping ingredients in a pan! It's topped with crunchy walnuts and melted butter for a delicious dessert.</p>
    <p>A dump cake is a cobbler-like dessert that features a cake-like topping. It gets its name from its easy method of preparation: The ingredients, one of which is boxed cake mix, are “dumped” in a cake pan without mixing.</p>
    
    <h1>Ingredients</h1>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Pie filling:</strong> This dump cake recipe calls for cherry pie filling, but you can use whatever pie filling you like. </li>
        <li><strong>Crushed pineapple:</strong> Two undrained cans of crushed pineapple (in 100% juice) lends fruity flavor and gives the dump cake a moist texture.</li>
        <li><strong>Cake mix:</strong> A box of yellow cake mix is the convenient secret ingredient in this easy dump cake recipe.</li>
        <li><strong>Walnuts:</strong> Chopped walnuts take the flavor and texture up a notch. Of course, you can leave them out if you prefer.</li>
        <li><strong>Butter:</strong> Melted butter drizzled over the other ingredients makes the cherry dump cake nice, moist, and rich.</li>          
    </ul>
